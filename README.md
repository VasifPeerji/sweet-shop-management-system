# 🍬 Sweet Shop Management System – FastAPI + React

A modern, fullstack Sweet Shop Management web application built using **FastAPI** (Python) and **React** (JavaScript), designed for managing sweets inventory, customer orders, cart/wishlist, and admin-level operations.

Developed as part of the **AI Kata Challenge by Incubyte**, this project combines a fast and scalable backend with a beautifully animated and responsive frontend. The system includes JWT-based authentication, MongoDB integration using Motor (async), cart and wishlist functionality, sweet browsing by category, and admin features for product and order management.

The frontend is built with **React**, **TailwindCSS**, **Framer Motion** for animations, and integrated with a fully functional backend using **FastAPI**. Authentication is implemented using JWT tokens and bcrypt for secure password hashing. The backend connects to **MongoDB Atlas**, and the API is designed in a RESTful structure using Pydantic models for validation.

The project was initialized using **Emergent**, accelerated by a well-engineered prompt with **ChatGPT**, and enhanced using tools like **Bolt.new** and **Claude AI**. The entire system was developed within 1–2 hours using a combination of coding experience, debugging, and prompt engineering.

Key highlights:
- 🔐 JWT-based authentication (Login, Register, Social Login)
- 🛒 Cart and Wishlist with live quantity updates
- 🧁 Sweet and Category management with stock and featured toggling
- 👨‍💼 Admin dashboard with full CRUD on sweets/orders
- 💥 Fully animated, mobile-responsive UI with themed support
- 🌐 Modern API design with full CRUD endpoints (`/auth`, `/cart`, `/orders`, `/wishlist`, `/admin`, etc.)

Built with passion, productivity tools, and an AI-assisted workflow.
